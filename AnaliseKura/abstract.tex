\setlength{\parindent}{5ex}Kura is one of the tools that based on the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGI) technology, supports the development of Internet-based applications of things (IoT). Because it is still in development, its documentation still presents some difficulties, such as ambiguity and missing steps. We then decide to evaluate the quality of the support that Kura gives to the development of plug-ins, and complement the official tutorials with solutions to the most common problems. Our documentation was tested by an external evaluator, who, having little knowledge of OSGI, was able to execute the tutorials successfully.\par
